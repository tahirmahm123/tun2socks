# Client for Tun2Socks
This project uses Tun2Sock Library from [Tun2Sock Core](https://github.com/tahirmahm123/go-tun2socks) which is actually a [fork](https://github.com/benchibench/go-tun2socks) but original code exists only on [Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benchibench/go-tun2socks)

This repo is a simple client to use tun2socks.


A tun2socks implementation written in Go.

Tested and worked on macOS, Linux and Windows, iOS and Android are also supported (as a library).

### Cross Compiling

An alternative way to build (or cross compile) tun2socks is to use [`xgo`](https://github.com/karalabe/xgo), to use `xgo`, you also need `docker`:

```sh
# install docker: https://docs.docker.com/install

# install xgo
go get github.com/karalabe/xgo

git clone https://github.com/tahirmahm123/tun2socks-client
make clean && make release
ls ./build
```

### Customizing Build

The default build behavior is to include all available modules, ends up a fat binary that will contain modules you may not need. It's easy to customize the build to include only modules you want by modifying the `Makefile`, for example, you may build `go-tun2socks` with only the `socks` proxy handler by setting the `BUILD_TAGS` variable before calling `make`:
```
# socks handler only
BUILD_TAGS=socks make

# socks handler with DNS cache
BUILD_TAGS="socks dnscache" make
```

## Run

```sh
./build/tun2socks -tunName tun1 -tunAddr 240.0.0.2 -tunGw 240.0.0.1 -proxyType socks -proxyServer 1.2.3.4:1086
```

Note that the TUN device may have a different name, and it should be a different name on Windows unless you have renamed it, so make sure use `ifconfig`, `ipconfig` or `ip addr` to check it out.

## Create TUN device and Configure Routing Table

Suppose your original gateway is 192.168.0.1. The proxy server address is 1.2.3.4.

The following commands will need root permissions.

### macOS

The program will automatically create a TUN device for you on macOS. To show the created TUN device, use ifconfig.

Delete original gateway:

```sh
route delete default
```

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
route add default 240.0.0.1
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
route add 1.2.3.4/32 192.168.0.1
```

After Exit Make sure to remove routes

```sh
route delete default
route delete 240.0.0.1
route delete 1.2.3.4/32 192.168.0.1
route add default 192.168.0.1
```
### Linux

The program will not create the TUN device for you on Linux. You need to create the TUN device by yourself:

```sh
ip tuntap add mode tun dev tun1
ip addr add 240.0.0.1 dev tun1
ip link set dev tun1 up
```

Delete original gateway:

```sh
ip route del default
```

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
ip route add default via 240.0.0.1
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
ip route add 1.2.3.4/32 via 192.168.0.1
```

### Windows

To create a TUN device on Windows, you need [Tap-windows](http://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/), refer [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/badvpn/wikis/tun2socks.wiki) for more information.

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
# Using 240.0.0.1 is not allowed on Windows, we use 10.0.0.1 instead
route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 metric 6
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
route add 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.1 metric 5
```

## A few notes for using V2Ray proxy handler
- Using V2Ray proxy handler: `tun2socks -proxyType v2ray -vconfig config.json`
- V2Ray proxy handler dials connections with a [V2Ray Instance](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/blob/master/functions.go)
- Configuration file must in JSON format
- Proxy server addresses in the configuration file should be IPs and not domains except your system DNS will match "direct" rules
- Configuration file should not contain direct `domain` rules, since they cause infinitely looping requests
- Dynamic routing happens prior to packets input to lwIP, the [V2Ray Router](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/blob/master/features/routing/router.go) is used to check if the IP packet matching "direct" tag, information available for the matching process are (protocol, destination ip, destination port)
- To enable dynamic routing, just set the `-gateway` argument, for example: `tun2socks -proxyType v2ray -vconfig config.json -gateway 192.168.0.1`
- The tag "direct" is hard coded to identify direct rules, which if dynamic routing is enabled, will indicate adding routes to the original gateway for the corresponding IP packets
- Inbounds are not necessary

## TODO
- Built-in routing rules and routing table management
- Support ICMP packets forwarding
- Make conn handlers [io.ReadWriteCloser](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReadWriteCloser)
- Add Close() method for core.LWIPStack
- Support TAP device in order to support IPv6 on Windows

## Development

The core part of this project is the `core` package, it focuses on `tun2socks`'s `2` part, the core package has fully IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP support, and only depends on lwIP (including a few [platform-dependent code](https://github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks/tree/master/core/src/custom)) and Go's standard library. On the one hand, IP packets input to or output from the `lwIP Stack` that initialized by `core.NewLWIPStack()`, on the other hand, TCP/UDP connections would "socksified" by the core package and can be handled by your own `core.TCPConnHandler`/`core.UDPConnHandler` implementation.

As for the `tun` part, different OS may has it's own interfaces.

For example:
- macOS
    - macOS has TUN/TAP support by its BSD kernel
    - Apple also provides an easy way to filter inbound or outbound IP packets by [`IP Filters`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/NKEConceptual/ip_filter_nke/ip_filter_nke.html) (Proxifier seems use this method)
- Linux
    - Linux has TUN/TAP support by the kernel
- Windows
    - Windows has no kernel support for TUN/TAP, but OpenVPN has [implemented one](https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows6)
- iOS
    - Apple provides [`NEPacketTunnelProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider), and one may read/write IP packets from/to the [`packetFlow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider/1406185-packetflow)
- Android
    - I am not familiar with Android, but it uses Linux as kernel so should also has TUN/TAP drivers support
    - Android also provides an easy way to read/write IP packets with [VpnService.Builder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService.Builder#establish())

Sample code for creating a `lwIP Stack` and doing IP packets inputing/outputing, please refer `cmd/tun2socks/main.go`. Sample code for implementing `core.TCPConnHandler`/`core.UDPConnHandler`, please refer `proxy/*`.
